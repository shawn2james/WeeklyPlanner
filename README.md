MVP:
This app lets the user easily plan out his week. It contains a full-week display that contains all the tasks for each day of the current week.
the page should display the day, month and year of each day.
The home page should also allow the users to access PREVIOUS WEEK and CURRENT WEEK
A new task button should be added which can set a task for any day from today(not just the current or next weeks).
The user should be able to access the tasks of any previous day by just choosing a previous date.
The tasks can be repeating(on specific weekdays or on every x days/weeks/months) and should be scheduled accordingly.


EXTRA:
Notifications should be issued at the specified time for each task.
The tasks for each day can be sorted according to: 1)order to be completed 2)importance/urgency. 
Each task can have a label which can be filtered through in the home page.
